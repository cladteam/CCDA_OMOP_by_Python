https://github.com/chrisroederucdenver/CCDA-data

Code here, prototype_2/value_transformations.py  loads the concept map from a file map_to_standard.csv from the local top leve.
It is not included in this repo however. It is in CCDA-tools.  Running locally, for the moment, requires the file to be copied over (or linked).
